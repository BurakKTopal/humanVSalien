# Java Concepts Example

This project demonstrates the implementation of various Java concepts including:

1. **Classes**: The basic building blocks of object-oriented programming in Java.
2. **Inheritance**: The mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class.
3. **Enums**: A special data type that allows for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.
4. **Threading**: The concurrent execution of two or more threads to execute multiple tasks simultaneously.
5. **Nested Classes**: Classes defined within another class, often used to logically group classes that are only used in one place.
6. **Serializable Class**: A class that implements the `Serializable` interface, allowing objects of the class to be converted into a byte stream for serialization.
7. **JUnit Testing**: A testing framework for Java that is used to write and run repeatable automated tests.
